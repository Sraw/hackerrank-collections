Actually, this challenge is a little tricky.

At a first glance, this challenge seems need a lot of calculations 
as we need to generate all possible combinations.

But actually this challenge can be simple as there aren't many valid magic squares.

So if we use a generator to iterate all possibles. Most of possibles can be rejected quickly.

Another solution may sounds like cheating. As there are only eight possible magic squares, 
we can hard-code them.
