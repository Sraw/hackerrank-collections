This challenge can be done very easily in Python as Python supports huge integer.

But a general solution should be string manipulation. So I implement `str_add` and `str_mul`.

`str_mul` can be implemented more elegantly and efficiently. 
But there has been many implementations and this one is enough to pass all test cases.
